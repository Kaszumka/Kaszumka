👋 Hi! I'm Hubert — a master's student in Automation and Robotics at Lodz University of Technology, with a bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering, specializing in Biomedical Informatics and Textronics.

🔬 I'm passionate about building applications for data acquisition and analysis, embedded systems, and smart wearable technologies. I have experience in R&D projects, including co-authoring a scientific publication on textile-based gas sensors.

🛠️ Technologies I work with:
- Programming: Python, Java, SQL
- Tools: Android Studio, ArduinoIDE, Git, VS Code
- Engineering software: Autodesk Inventor, Ansys, Creo

📱 On my GitHub you'll find:
- A mobile app for managing plant care and watering schedules (Java, Android Studio)
- A relational database project for managing a car repair workshop (SQL)
🚀 I'm currently expanding my skills in mobile development and IoT. I'm always open to new challenges and collaborative projects.
